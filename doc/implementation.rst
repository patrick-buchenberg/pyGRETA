Implementation
===============

You can run the code by typing::

	$ python runme.py
	
The script ``runme.py`` calls the main functions of the code, which are explained in the following sections.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   source/initialization
   source/input_maps
   source/potential
   source/time_series
   source/regression

Helping functions for the models are included in ``correction_functions.py``, ``spatial_functions.py``, and ``physical_models.py``.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3
   
   source/correction_functions
   source/spatial_functions
   source/physical_models
   
Utility functions as well as imported libraries are included in ``util.py``.
